      <h3>This is 7.</h3>
      <p>iPhone 7 dramatically improves the most important aspects of the iPhone experience. It introduces advanced new camera systems. The best performance and battery life ever in an iPhone. Immersive stereo speakers. The brightest, most colourful iPhone display. Splash and water resistance.1 And it looks every bit as powerful as it is. This is iPhone 7.</p>
      <p>iPhone 7 reaches a new level of innovation and precision. The jet black finish is like nothing we’ve ever made. The enclosure is splash and water resistant.1 The Home button is completely re-engineered. And with a new unibody design that’s seamless to the touch, iPhone 7 feels as amazing as it looks</p>
      <h4>Two sizes. Stunning finishes.</h4>
      <p>With iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, we’re introducing a beautiful black with a matt finish and a deep, high-gloss jet black. Both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models — constructed with incredibly strong 7000 Series aluminium — are also available in our signature silver, gold and rose gold finishes.</p>
